# Project Title: MyToken (AbhiOp)

## Simple Overview

Hey there! Welcome to our project, MyToken (AbhiOp)! This project is part of our journey in the Metacrafters ETH PROOF: Beginner EVM Course, where we've been learning all about Solidity, Blockchain and Ethereum development using Remix IDE.

## Description

MyToken (AbhiOp) is a Solidity smart contract designed to manage a custom cryptocurrency token on the Ethereum blockchain. It's pretty neat because it lets us do cool stuff like create new tokens and burn existing ones. Plus, it keeps track of who owns what tokens, which is super handy.

### Installing
To get started with MyToken (AbhiOp), you'll want to fire up Remix IDE. That's where all the magic happens! From there, you can deploy our smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain.

### Executing Token

1. Deploy the `MyToken` contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
2. Interact with the contract using Ethereum wallets or through other smart contracts.
3. Use the `mint` function to create new tokens and the `burn` function to destroy existing tokens.

### Help

If you encounter any issues or have questions about using the MyToken (SKJ) contract, refer to the documentation provided with your Ethereum development tools or seek assistance from the Ethereum developer community or you can directly reach out me for this token(SKJ) particularly using the below mentioned contact details.
